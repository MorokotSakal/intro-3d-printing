### 2.2. 3D Modeling Basics
To get started, 
1. Create account at Tinkercad
2. Go to [Learning Center --> 3D Design](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/designs)

Ask students to complete the lessons below:
- Starters (All required)
  - Place it
  - View it
  - Move it
  - Rotate it
  - Size it
  - Group it
  - Copy it
  - Duplicate it
  - Hide it
  - Align it
  - Creating hole
- Jewelry (Choose 3 from below)
- Buttons (Choose 3 from below)
- Gadgets (Choose 3 from below)

### 2.3. Designing for 3D Printing 
In this short online course, students will learn about the best practices for designing in Tinkercad software, specifically for 3D printing. The course is video based and goes over 10 essential tips to achieving good quality prints on FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) 3D printers - from overhanging features and bridges to wall thicknesses and tolerances.

### 2.5. Sample Project 
Ask to student to follow some example projects in the following pages:
- PrintLab Class
  - #1 [Pandemic Product](https://classroom.weareprintlab.com/p/pandemic-products)
- TinkerCad 3D Design [Projects](https://www.tinkercad.com/projects?product=design)

### 2.6. Practice - 3D Modeling Project
Create your own design from scratch.  You can not design something that is already present on TinkerCad website.
